abstract = "Abstract Genomic selection (GS) is a powerful method for exploitation of DNA sequence polymorphisms in breeding improvement, through the prediction of breeding values based on all markers distributed genome-wide. Forage grasses and legumes provide important targets for GS implementation, as many key traits are difficult or expensive to assess, and are measured late in the breeding cycle. Generic attributes of forage breeding programmes are described, along with status of genomic resources for a representative species group (ryegrasses). Two schemes for implementing GS in ryegrass breeding are described. The first requires relatively little modification of current schemes, but could lead to significant reductions in operating cost. The second scheme would allow two rounds of selection for key agronomic traits within a time period previously required for a single round, potentially leading to doubling of genetic gain rate, but requires a purpose-designed reference population. In both schemes, the limited extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD), which is the major challenge for GS implementation in ryegrass breeding, is addressed. The strategies also incorporate recent advances in DNA sequencing technology to minimize costs."
